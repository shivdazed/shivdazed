This repository contains the sum of all programs I have practised and created from scratch on PyCHARM IDE.

It contains the tutorial programs as well as a few projects and their respective source code from a Python and Data certification course.
Alongside other ventures I have taken such as 
Miniprojects in Python https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg
Rocketship destroyer(using PyGame library)
Audio Visualiser and Analyzer using Pysound and PI libraries
Some fun practise sessions in Turtle
and many more simple but involving programs and exercises.
