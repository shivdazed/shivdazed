Hi, Iâ€™m Anuroop Shivdasan@shivdazed. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who looks for problems which are perplexing, paralysing and paradoxical. 
Challenging the Optimal Worst Case Scenario is my principle for efficient programming

Iâ€™m perplexed in the concept of learning implented with a programmatic and algorithmic approach; all of which are done in iterations.

Iâ€™m currently learning methods to create my own custom machine learning functions in Python. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Convolutional Neural Networks which may help to study the ginourmous functionalities of the Human Brain and possibly unravel 
human conciousness

This repository contains the sum of all programs I have practised and created from scratch on PyCHARM IDE.

It contains the tutorial programs as well as a few projects and their respective source code from a Python and Data certification course.
Alongside other ventures I have taken such as 
Miniprojects in Python https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg
Rocketship destroyer(using PyGame library)
Audio Visualiser and Analyzer using Pysound and PI libraries
Some fun practise sessions in Turtle
and many more simple but involving programs and exercises.
